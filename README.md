# chain_reaction_webapp
Web App version of chain reaction, frontend will look best on a laptop or tablet screen, but can be viewed on a phone browser too.
Developed with HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS<br>
[Known Bugs: Extremely large reaction(covering more than approximately 60-70% of the board) causes the web app to pause and run an infinite loop, effectively stalling execution inifinitely.
Will be fixed in the next release.]
